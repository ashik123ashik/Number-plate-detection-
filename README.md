Project Overview
The "Number Plate Detection of Vehicles" project aims to develop an automated system capable of detecting and recognizing vehicle number plates from images or live video streams. This system leverages computer vision techniques to identify number plates and extract relevant information, facilitating applications such as traffic monitoring, parking management, and law enforcement.

Technical Approach
Image Preprocessing:

Convert input images to grayscale to simplify further processing.

Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise and improve edge detection.

Use Canny edge detection to highlight edges in the image.

Apply morphological transformations to close gaps in the edges.

Plate Detection:

Utilize contour detection to identify potential regions of interest that may contain number plates.

Filter contours based on area and aspect ratio to isolate the number plate region.
Medium

Character Segmentation and Recognition:

Segment individual characters from the detected number plate region.

Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools like EasyOCR or PyTesseract to recognize the segmented characters.
